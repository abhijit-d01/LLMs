# Awesome LLM Projects

This repository is a curated collection of various projects and resources related to Large Language Models (LLMs). Whether you're a beginner exploring the field or an experienced practitioner, you'll find a range of examples, from simple scripts to more complex applications, that demonstrate different aspects of working with LLMs.

## üìÇ Project Structure

Each project is organized into its own directory with a clear and concise name. Inside each directory, you will typically find:

  - `README.md`: A project-specific README that explains what the project does, its dependencies, and how to run it.
  - `requirements.txt`: A file listing the necessary Python libraries.
  - `code`: The main source code for the project.

## üöÄ Projects

Here are some of the projects currently in this repository:

### **1. Basic Chatbot**

  - **Description:** A simple, command-line chatbot built using a popular LLM API. This project is perfect for understanding the fundamentals of sending prompts and receiving responses.
  - **Key Concepts:** API integration, basic prompt engineering.
  - **Dependencies:** `openai` or `anthropic` (depending on the specific LLM used).

### **2. Text Summarizer**

  - **Description:** A script that takes a long block of text and generates a concise summary. It's a great example of how to use LLMs for content generation and information extraction.
  - **Key Concepts:** Prompt engineering for summarization, handling long inputs.
  - **Dependencies:** `transformers` (if using a local model) or an LLM API library.

### **3. RAG System**

  - **Description:** A project demonstrating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. It shows how to combine an LLM with an external knowledge base (like a PDF or a set of documents) to generate more informed and accurate responses.
  - **Key Concepts:** Vector databases, embeddings, information retrieval, advanced prompt chaining.
  - **Dependencies:** `langchain`, `faiss-cpu`, `sentence-transformers`.

### **4. Fine-Tuning Example**

  - **Description:** A step-by-step guide and code for fine-tuning a smaller LLM for a specific task, such as sentiment analysis or a domain-specific Q\&A.
  - **Key Concepts:** Dataset preparation, model fine-tuning, PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) methods like LoRA.
  - **Dependencies:** `transformers`, `torch`, `peft`, `datasets`.
